# ML-Drowsiness-Detection-system
The model is designed to detect closed eyes for a duration exceeding 2 seconds, triggering an alarm.It has the capability to prevent accidents caused by drowsy individuals or drunkards driving cars. 
Additionally I bruteforced the code 👨‍💻 so that a simple blink of an eye 👁️ 👁️ won't trigger the alarm 🚨🚨
This innovation holds significant potential for individuals who drive during early mornings 🌄 🌄 or late nights 🌉🌃 who sometimes nod off while driving.
Additionally, it can prove invaluable in situations where people may pass out due to alcohol 🍷🍷 consumption, aiding them in regaining alertness by identifying drowsy or intoxicated eyes and activating the alarm – an audible beep 🔔🔔
I used Mobile-net architecture and used the closed and open eyes data set of 8000 images from Kaggle.
Also I used the transfer learning algorithm in which I changed the last few layers of the Neural Networks. I used the adam optimizer for optimization and the cross entropy loss function as the cost function
